== ✨ UNLIMITED 3D VIEWERS ✨ ==

The Visody 3D product viewer plugin allows you to add an unlimited amount of 3D viewers to your WordPress and WooCommerce website! Simply install the plugin, create 3D viewers and upload your 3D models. Full functionalities. Zero limitations!

== 📱 BUILT-IN AR SUPPORT 📱 ==

The Visody 3D product viewer supports AR-capabilies on the last two major versions of all evergreen desktop and mobile browsers, plus the last two versions of Safari (on MacOS and iOS).

== ✅ SUPPORTED 3D FILE TYPES ✅ ==

The 3D product viewer can only load GLB or glTF 3D models. If you have a different model type, simply convert your model to GLB or glTF using your favorite 3D model editor. Most 3D model editors support export to GLB or glTF.

The plugin allows you to upload your GLB or glTF 3D models right into WordPress media library. If you are concerned about server disk space, you can also choose to upload your 3D model elsewhere and link it using an URL, instead of uploading it to WordPress itself.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. I can't upload 3D models. What should I do? =

Please read [this article on our website](https://visody.com/upload-3d-models-in-wordpress/) on how to upload 3D models to your WordPress website.

= Q. Can I use the Visody 3D viewer when I do not have GLB or glTF 3D models? =
